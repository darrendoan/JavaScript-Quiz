# JavaScript Quiz

## Description 

In this week's homework challenge, we were tasked with creating a mulitple choice quiz that has a timer, a scoring system and the ability to store scores and initials. This task required us to critically think and apply our knowledge on JavaScript. Some problems that I ran into were the timer counting down in intervals of 2 and the alert window popping up twice. Due to my limited programming knowledge, some solutions were easily found through the internet and these problems included: how to store objects in local storage, how to parse an object and how to run a function under varying circumstances.
